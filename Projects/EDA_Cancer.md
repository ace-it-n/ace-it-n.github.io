About the Dataset:
Abstract: Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database

The Breast Cancer Diagnostic data is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes. The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

- There are no missing values in the Dataset.
- All the features are scaled using  Scikit-Learn Standard Scaler.
- Target variable is Label encoded using Scikit-Learn Label Encoder.
- Most features appear to have a direct proportional with the Target Variable (Diagnosis).
- Many features appear to be correlated heavily on each other hence, feature selection needs to be done appropriately to select the best possible features.
